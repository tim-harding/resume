Hi Josh,

Thank you again for offering your help in my job hunt. It's taken me some time to consider how to pitch myself in a cover letter --- I hope I've written an effective expression of my personality and intent. One resource I've found helpful suggests a cover letter should be at least 75% unique per company, but I've done my best for a generic introduction. 

Please let me know if you need anything else from me, either related to these materials or otherwise. I may not have a great deal to offer today, but I hope that in another year I'll be in a better position to give back and affect change. 

Best,

- Tim
